dartlang-playfair
=================

A demonstration of the playfair cipher in Dart.

This was a project to test my own skills and see if I could create an app/toy to perform the playfair cipher.

You can play around with it by cloning the repository and going to File->Open Existing Folder in the Dart Editor and selecting the director you cloned into.

The compiled javascript has not yet been tested stand-alone, though it has been tested.
